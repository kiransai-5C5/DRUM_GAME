# 🥁 Drum Kit Project

This is a simple and interactive **Drum Kit Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It's designed for beginners to learn how to use event listeners and audio in the browser. Each button represents a drum sound, and when clicked, it plays a unique sound — just like a real drum set!

## 🎮 How It Works

- The app displays seven drum buttons: **w, a, s, d, j, k, l**.
- When a user clicks any of the buttons, a corresponding drum sound is played.
